                <p class="who-are-we-text cap tac exo">From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was
                    signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". The DVD
                    release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability,
                    it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine
                    or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.</p>

                <!--<div class="mn-image tac"></div>-->
                <img src="assets/images/michael-nesmith.jpg" alt="Michael Nesmith">
                <p class="who-are-we-text cap tac exo">From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band The Monkees, created for the television situation comedy of the same name. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone showed
                    him a copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys", so he applied for the job. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blas√© when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat
                    to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back. Once he was cast, Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith
                    wrote for The Monkees, such as "The Girl I Knew Somewhere", "Mary, Mary", and "Listen to the Band", became minor hits. One song he wrote, "You Just May Be the One", is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.
                    The Gretsch guitar company built a one-off, natural-finish, 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was performing with The Monkees. (Gretsch had a promotional deal with the group.) He earlier played a customized Gretsch 12-string,
                    which had originally been a six-string model. Nesmith used this guitar for his appearances on the television series, as well as The Monkees' live appearances in 1966 and 1967. Beginning in 1968, Nesmith used a white six-string Gibson
                    SG Custom for his live appearances with The Monkees. He used that guitar in their motion picture Head for the live version of "Circle Sky", and also for the final original Monkees tour in 1969 with Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz. In a
                    post on his Facebook page in 2011, Nesmith reported that both guitars were stolen in the early 1970s. As with the other Monkees, Nesmith came to be frustrated by the manufactured image of the whole project. He was permitted to write
                    and produce two songs per album, and his music was frequently featured in episodes of the series. Nesmith was the most publicly vocal Monkee about the band's prefabricated image.</p>

                <h3>Mikey Dolenz</h3>
                <!--<div class="md-image tac"></div>-->
                <img src="assets/images/mikey-dolenz.jpg" alt="Mikey Dolenz">
                <p class="who-are-we-text cap tac exo">In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually
                    was taught how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself. He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making
                    his right leg weak. Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, writers of many of The Monkees' songs, observed quickly that when brought into the studio together, the four actors would try to make each other laugh. Because of this, the writers often
                    brought in each singer individually. The antics escalated until one time Dolenz poured a cup of Coca-Cola on Don Kirshner's head; at the time, Dolenz did not know Kirshner on sight. According to Mike Nesmith, Dolenz's voice made The
                    Monkees' sound distinctive, and during tension-filled times, Nesmith and Peter Tork voluntarily turned over lead vocal duties to Dolenz on their own compositions.

                <p class="who-are-we-text cap tac exo">Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth would not photograph well on camera. They asked Stills if he knew of someone
                    with a similar "open, Nordic look," and Stills suggested Tork audition for the part. Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a fictitious pop band in the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom written
                    about the fictitious band. Tork was the oldest member of the group. Tork was a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception, playing what he
                    described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He also co-wrote,
                    along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake". On the television show, he was relegated to playing the "lovable dummy," a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New
                    York's Greenwich Village. The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In it, Nesmith stated that Tork was better at playing guitar than bass. In Tork's commentary, he stated that
                    Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was
                    done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards. Recording and producing as a group was Tork's major interest, and he hoped that the four members would
                    continue working together as a band on future recordings. However, the four did not have enough in common regarding their musical interests. In commentary for the DVD release of the second season of the show, Tork said that Dolenz
                    was "incapable of repeating a triumph". Dolenz felt that once he had accomplished something and became a success at it, there was no artistic sense in repeating a formula. Jones and Tork, 1966 Tork, once free from Don Kirshner's restrictions,
                    in 1967, contributed some of the most memorable and catchy instrumental flourishes, such as the piano introduction to "Daydream Believer" and the banjo part on "You Told Me", as well as exploring occasional songwriting with the likes
                    of "For Pete's Sake" and "Lady's Baby".</p>

                    <h4>THE BEGINNING</h4>
                    <p>They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. </p>

                <div class="timeline-item" dates="1968">
                    <h4>SHOW CANCELLATION</h4>
                    <p>NBC felt the series had run its course. Coupled with friction within the band itself, the series was cancelled in 1968. The Monkees released three more albums after the series cancellation but they did not chart well.</p>

                <div class="timeline-item" dates="1968 - 1971">
                    <h4>THE BIG FOLLOWING</h4>
                    <p>Following the television show's cancellation in 1968, the Monkees continued to record music until 1971</p>

                    <h4>CHRISTMAS PARTY</h4>
                    <p>Christmas Party is the thirteenth album by the Monkees. Produced mainly by Adam Schlesinger (with Michael Nesmith's tracks produced by his sons Christian and Jonathan), the album is the Monkees' first to focus on Christmas music. It
                        follows on the success of their 2016 album Good Times! The two-year gap is the shortest between albums since the 1969/1970 releases of The Monkees Present and Changes. The album features surviving Monkees Micky Dolenz, Mike Nesmith,
                        and Peter Tork, as well as two posthumous contributions from Davy Jones. Unfortunatley this has been called the last Monkees album due to the death of Peter Tork in February 2019.</p>
